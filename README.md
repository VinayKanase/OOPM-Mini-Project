## 🧐 Problem Statment <a name = "about"></a>

The global pharmaceutical manufacturing market size was estimated at USD 485.52 billion in 2021. With a industry as huge as this, there is a need to keep track of all the medicines and equipment and keep everything organized. The Medistore helps in this task.

### Objectives

- Keep track of all the Medicines in stock.
- Register the details of new and improved - medicines.
- Ensure all the medicines in stock are within expiry date.

### Goals

- Keep all necessary medicines in stock
- Minimize human workload to generate bills from database.
- Minimize human error in giving expired medicines

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Download this repository or clone. For cloning this repository go to Installing part

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Java

### Repository Cloning

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VinayKanase/OOPM-Mini-Project.git
```

Check if `OOPM-Mini-Project` directory added to your current selected folder

### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- Open a command prompt or terminal window.
- Navigate to the root folder of your project that contains the src, bin, and lib folders.
- Compile the source code by running the javac command followed by the path to the source files.

```sh
javac -cp lib/* -d bin src/*.java
```

This command tells the compiler to use the jars in the `lib` folder to compile your code, and to put the resulting class files in the `bin` folder.

- If there are any errors during the compilation process, fix them before proceeding.

- Once the source code has been compiled, you can run the project by specifying the main class. To run the project, use the java command followed by the fully qualified name of the main class.

```sh
java -cp bin/ Pharmacy
```
