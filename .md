## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## How to run a program in Java Project

- Open a command prompt or terminal window.
- Navigate to the root folder of your project that contains the src, bin, and lib folders.
- Compile the source code by running the javac command followed by the path to the source files.

```sh
javac -cp lib/* -d bin src/*.java
```

This command tells the compiler to use the jars in the `lib` folder to compile your code, and to put the resulting class files in the `bin` folder.

- If there are any errors during the compilation process, fix them before proceeding.

- Once the source code has been compiled, you can run the project by specifying the main class. To run the project, use the java command followed by the fully qualified name of the main class.

```sh
java -cp bin/ Pharmacy
```
